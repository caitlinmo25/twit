Reflects the Relationship: This arrangement is essential to accurately reflect the directional nature of the "following" relationship. In social platforms, user A following user B does not imply that user B is following user A. Each row in the Follows table represents a unique "follow" relationship where one user is the follower and the other is the followed.
Facilitates Queries: This structure allows for more straightforward and efficient queries to determine relationships like who follows whom, who is the most followed, etc. It makes it easy to handle the relationships in queries using joins.
Maintains Integrity and Reduces Anomalies: By using foreign keys, the database ensures referential integrity. The actions like deletions or updates on the User table can be cascaded to the Follows table to maintain consistency. For example, if a user is deleted, their follow relationships can also be automatically removed to prevent data anomalies.
